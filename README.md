# Overview

This repository contains a reduced simulated data set of household energy bills
for the Duke territories in North Carolina. For file-size reasons, many columns
such as demographics are omitted from this data. For the methodology involved
in generating this synthetic data from publicly available survey data, see
PSE Healthy Energy's report [Pathways to Energy Affordability in Colorado](https://www.psehealthyenergy.org/our-work/publications/archive/energy-affordability-colorado/)

Additionally, this repository contains a jupyter notebook with
python code for the analysis of this household data to generate plots as shown in PSE's
report [Review and Comments on Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress,
LLCâ€™s 2022 Proposed Carbon Plan](https://starw1.ncuc.gov/NCUC/ViewFile.aspx?Id=b4fd3a5d-375b-4619-97d0-2b0ab2186d62)
